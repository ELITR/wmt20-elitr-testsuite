# WMT20 Elitr Annotation Frontend

Built with TypeScript/Webpack frontend and Python/Flask backend and processing scripts.

## Development

### Interface

After `git clone` and `npm install` run `npm run build`, which outputs the whole frontend to `interface/dist`.

Furthermore you can run `npm run dev`, which starts a local http server and serves the current project and recompiles & reloads on any code change.

### Server

To run the server simply execute the `run.sh`. Make sure that the url and the port matches the one specified in the interface.

## Experiment preparation

To run the experiment, two files must be supplied: `content.json` and `queue_user.json`. These files are produced using provided scripts from an `experiment.yaml` file and a directory of documents. The `json` files need to be put in the `backend/logs` directory so that the server can use them. The output of this experiment is a file `backend/logs/rating_user.json` where the user ratings are stored.

The `experiment.yaml` file has four top-level components: `users`, `docs`, `mts` and `markables`. An example `experiment.yaml` file is provided in the `processing/` directory.

- `users` is a list of user ids
- `mts` is a list of machine translation submission models
- `docs` is a list of documents to be evaluated
- `markables` is a list of keys, which then map to a list of corresponding forms in the _source_ language

```
markables:
  uni:
    - university
    - univerzita
    - univerzit

  literature:
    - literature
    - literatura
    - literatury
    - literatu≈ôe
...
```

Assuming the relevant `experiment.yaml` file has been written and that the documents are stored in `example_docs` in the format of `DOCNAME_MTNAME.xml` you can run the following commands to generate experiment and copy it to the desctination.

```
processing/src/prepare_queue.py processing/experiment.yaml processing/example_docs/
processing/src/prepare_content.py processing/experiment.yaml processing/example_docs/
mv {content,queue_user}.json backend/logs/
```
