Contrary to popular belief, <m m="lorem">Lorem</m> Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin <m m='lit'>literature</m> from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <m m="lorem">Lorem</m> Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <m m='lit'>literature</m>, discovered the undoubtable source. <m m="lorem">Lorem</m> Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of <m m="lorem">Lorai</m> Ipsum, "<m m="lorem">Lorem</m> ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
